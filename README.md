# Project-Core

## What is Project Core?
The Project Core is a 3D Printer project. This project dedicated to create modular hardware for 3D Printer.

## The Things We Currently Work On!
- Core MCU
    - STM32F446 
    - STM32F407
- Core Driver
    - TMC 2208 (UART)
    - TMC 2209 (UART)
    - TMC 5160 (SPI)
- Core N 8 Axis Board
    - Core Version (With Core Driver)
    - Legacy Compatible
- Core 1DT (1 Driver Tester)
    - STM32F103
    - Basic 1 driver board
    - Able run Core Driver with UART or SPI

## The Things Maybe I Will do at future..
- Core Part maker!
    - The 3D Printer maker other 3D Printer part 
- Core SLS
    - Simple SLS Printer
- Core DLP
    - Print Resin
